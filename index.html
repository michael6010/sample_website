	   <h1>Learn Enough Story</h1>
	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
		technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can         benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join          our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email"> sign up for our 		official email list</a> now.
